## Break Detection in Large Covariance Matrices of High-Dimensional Quantile Factor Models

The paper proposes a framework for structural break testing and estimation in the structure of large covariance matrices for high-dimensional quantile factor models. The structural break testing utilizes a CUSUM-based detection technique which is flexible to various econometric conditions. The testing methodology relies on vectorized model residuals which captures fluctuations in the underline stochastic processes. We propose a novel data segementation and window estimation procedure which captures the covariance structure and allows to estimate the break-point locations based on the entries of the matrix from both the common components of the high-dimensional quantile factor model as well as the corresponding error components of the model.
